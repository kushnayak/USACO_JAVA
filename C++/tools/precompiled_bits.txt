brew install gcc@9 then bits/stdc++.h should be in the dir below (or just use -H flag to
when compiling g++-9 with to see where include paths are):
/usr/local/Cellar/gcc@9/9.3.0_1/include/c++/9.3.0/x86_64-apple-darwin20/bits/

Compile above bits/stdc++.h using same flags as cpp flags then when -H flag is used again
bits/stdc++.h.gch should be shown meaning precompile leads to faster compilation

use #include <bits/stdc++.h> if you compiled in /usr/local/Cellar/... itself or if you compiled locally use #include "bits/stdc++.h" to make it search locally
